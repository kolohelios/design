# CSS design

The objective was to duplicate the look of two websites as closely as possible using only HTML5 and CSS3 (i.e. no frameworks or libraries). I did not refer to the page source and used the inspector on the original pages only infrequently. In other words, most of the work was done by eye. Please note that the pages I made are not responsive and were built at a specific resolution.

The first website is based on (Archeeve)[http://www.archeeve.com/]; you may view it (here)[http://design.kolohelios.com/design/archeeve.html].

The second website is (Rumble Labs)[http://rumblelabs.com/]; it's available (here)[http://design.kolohelios.com/design/rumble-labs.html].
